# Layouts

This folder in my repository will show a variety of layouts of web pages.


## Experience

In this experience, I was able to make 4 webpages. One featured graphic, 5 boxes, 3 boxes and with a locked side bar. 



## Problems

Problems i encountered, One was with manipulating the margin. Placing text over an img. Logo and body content was overlapping or unseen.



## Todos

If I had more time to make this i wouldn't copy paste everything, i would save a html skeleton on my desktop so i could organize my codes easier. Organized codes would help me identify where errors would come from.
